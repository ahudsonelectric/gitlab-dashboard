## Overview

### What is Gitlab Dashboard?

Gitlab Dashboard is a browser extension that helps developers that use Gitlab as version control system to keep track of their project and branches in real time.

It displays information of private (self-hosted) or public Gitlab projects, like name and opened merge requests and also the current status of their pipeline.

After configuring the version control system API access, the user can select which projects and branches should be displayed on dashboard.

### Why did we develop Gitlab Dashboard?

Unfortunately, Gitlab does not provide a dashboard that can display information about our projects and their pipeline.
To help developers to monitor Gitlab projects health, Gitlab Dashboard was developed.

### What can we do in this version?

**Monitor your Gitlab projects/branches** in our browser! At the moment, we support only Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

**Manage your Gitlab projects/branches** to display in dashboard just those items that you need.

**Configure multiple Gitlabs**, so you will be able to monitor projects from private (self-hosted) and public Gitlabs.
